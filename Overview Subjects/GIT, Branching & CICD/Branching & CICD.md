# An overview on Branching strategies and how to implement CICD

### Branching strategies : 

Choosing the branching strategie is a critical task that needs to be well tought in order to handel the technical aspect of the project and how developpers collaborate !  

We have several branchs strategies ! 

| **Strategy**                | **What it Does**                                                                                         | **Application Development**                                                                                                           | **Data Engineering**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Branching**       | Each feature/bug is developed in an isolated branch, merged after testing. Relies heavely on CICD        | - Branch per feature (`feature/x`).<br>- CI runs unit/integration tests.<br>- Easy rollback by redeploying older version.             | - Branch per feature with migration scripts + pipeline code.<br>- Needs test DB/warehouse for validation.<br>- Rollback harder (schemas & data).                                        |
| **Git Flow**                | Uses long-lived branches (`main`, `develop`) with support branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. | - `main` = production-ready.<br>- `develop` = integration branch.<br>- Release branches for stabilization.<br>- Hotfixes from `main`. | - `main` = production pipelines/schemas.<br>- `develop` = integration with test data.<br>- Release branches for schema/pipeline versioning.<br>- Hotfix = emergency DAG/ETL/schema fix. |
| **Trunk-Based Development** | Developers commit frequently to `main` (short-lived branches only), relying on CI/CD automation.         | - Continuous integration & deployment.<br>- Feature flags mitigate incomplete work.<br>- Ideal for fast-moving teams.                 | - Works only if schema changes are backward-compatible.<br>- May require blue/green data deployments.<br>- Risky without strong rollback strategy.                                      |
| **Release Branching**       | Creates a dedicated branch per release version, stabilized before production.                            | - `release/x.y.z` branch.<br>- Only bug fixes until release.<br>- Helps coordinate large launches.                                    | - `release/q3-schema` branch.<br>- Consolidates schema/pipeline changes for a release cycle.<br>- Ensures synchronized rollout across systems.                                          |
| **Environment Branching**   | Branches map to deployment environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).                                      | - Rare (apps usually separate environments by deployment, not branch).                                                                | - Common: `dev` → test DB, `staging` → staging warehouse, `prod` → production.<br>- Critical since code materializes real tables, streams, DAGs.                                        |
| **Forking Workflow**        | Developers fork the repo, work independently, and submit pull requests.                                  | - Common in open source projects.<br>- Useful for external contributors.                                                              | - Rare.<br>- Could be used if multiple organizations collaborate on shared data pipelines.                                                                                              |


#### The are some big differences between branching an application development project and data projects :  


| Aspect                  | Application Development                                                         | Data Engineering                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Materialization**     | Code produces artifacts (binaries, containers), but not permanent side effects. | Code **materializes state** (tables, streams, dashboards, DAG runs).                               |
| **Rollback**            | Easy → redeploy previous version.                                               | Harder → need schema rollback, data correction, or replay.                                         |
| **Testing**             | Unit/integration tests simulate behavior.                                       | Must test with **realistic datasets**, and validate schema + data quality.                         |
| **Branch Environments** | Not always needed (preview apps exist).                                         | Almost always needed (dev/staging/prod warehouses).                                                |
| **Strategy Fit**        | Feature branching or trunk-based work well.                                     | Git Flow + environment branching often better (because schema migration needs careful sequencing). |
| **Hotfixes**            | Quick redeploy.                                                                 | Emergency DAG fix, schema rollback, or reprocess pipeline.                                         |


#### Best Strategy for Data Engineering: 

##### Feature Branching + Environments (dev, test/staging, prod)

Feature Branching:

- Developers isolate schema changes, ETL/DAG updates, transformations, etc. in a branch (feature/add-country-code).

- Merge back via PR after code review + CI tests.

- Environments (dev → test/staging → prod):

We don’t need a branch per environment (too messy).

Instead, we deploy the same code to different environments using pipeline variables/configs.

Example:

- dev uses small test DB.

- staging uses full warehouse copy (but not prod tables).

- prod uses live warehouse.

Here the CD part will deploy the code in each evironnement using the secrets and the variables of that environment !
